# AI-Enhanced Fracture Mechanics Simulation

## Overview
This software aims to simulate **3D crack growth** in structures using **Finite Element Methods (FEM)** and integrates **AI** to enhance fracture prediction and optimize simulations. The software offers the ability to **import models** from industry-standard tools such as NX, Abaqus, ANSYS, and Nastran, providing users with seamless workflow integration.

## Key Features
- **AI Integration**: Use machine learning models to predict crack propagation and optimize simulation parameters.
- **Finite Element Analysis**: Leverages the **deal.II** library for FEM, ensuring efficient and accurate simulations.
- **Multi-Platform Model Import**: Supports importing models from NX, Abaqus, ANSYS, and Nastran.
- **Documentation**: Follows a well-structured documentation style similar to **deal.II**, with detailed equations, algorithms, and explanations.

## Model Import Capabilities
This software allows users to import models from:
- **Abaqus**: `.inp` files for geometry, mesh, and material properties.
- **Nastran**: `.bdf`, `.dat` files.
